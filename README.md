# Adaptive Distributed Chat Application Using Spring Framework

Adaptive distributed chat application was implemented in java in previous work ([The previous implemented chat application](https://github.com/wbudgaga/distributedChat)). The Spring Framework was used to add adaptive features to thhat application to address its limitations.

## Problem Description:
In this extention, we addressed the problems and limitions that exist in the orginal chat application. The problems are:
- The chat application has only one chat server, which means there is a single point of failure. Failing the server leads to stopping of all its services
- In the original chat application, the chat groups have a fixed size. The group size should be dynamic so that it increases once the activity in the group increases and shrinks otherwise. 
- In the previous implementation, the application does not take advantage of active big groups for investment. Many commercial companies would like to publish their advertisements to reach the highest selling rate in order to increase their revenue.
- In the chat application, the chat server assigns a new chat client to the smallest chat group to balance the sizes among the groups. The problem here is that the chat clients are forced to join particular chat groups. 

## Solution:
To address the menitioned problems with minimum complexity in either design and implementation, we have used Spring framework. The framework I used to add adaption features the original chat application. That is, we solved the problems by adding the adaptive features to the application.


## Adaptive Features
These adaptive features are the key that lets the application to adapt itself based on occurred events and conditions. The following adaptive features have been added to application to solve the menitioned limitations:

* ### Implementing a mirror chat server
To solve the issues associated with a single point of failure in the chat application, I added another server (referred to as a mirror chat server). Both servers should run on different machines. The original chat server launches the mirror server immediately when it starts and keeps updating the mirror server about any changes.
To accomplish this task, I implemented a remote monitoring component that runs on the same mirror server's machine. The role of this component is to keep checking whether the original server is still listening on its port. 
When the monitoring component detects that the original server has  the failed, 
it informs the mirror server that directly adapts itself to become the main chat server. 

* ### Merging small groups into one group
Because the chat clients can join and leave at any time, some chat groups might become very small, which leads to resource wasting. To balance the size of the groups, I implemented a mechanism for merging groups that are staying small for a particular period into one chat group.  I defined two variables--one has been used to define the maximum size below which a group is considered as small and the other variable has been used to define the period length at which a group cannot be small. Both variables are configurable even at run time.
The groups that are considered as small will be monitored for the defined time and then merged if they are still small.

* ### Increasing the maximum size of active groups
A chat group is considered as an active group when the rate of exchanged messages exceeds a conÔ¨Ågurable threshold.

* ### Sending of advertising messages to active groups
* ### Inviting of chat clients


## Application Folder
The main folder, distributedChat,  contains :
- makefile: it is used to compile java classes(make all) and remove classes (make clean)
- MANIFEST.MF:  needed to create chatApp.jar
- src: contains java source packages
- bin: 
  - chatApp_lib: contains all needed runtime libraries
	- cs518/a4/distributedchat: contains the compiled java classes in their packages
	- chatApp.jar: Runnable chat application
	- ChatClient.sh: a script that is used to run chat application client and to create chatApp.jar if it does not exist
	- ChatServer.sh: a script that is used to run chat application server and to create chatApp.jar if it does not exist
- lib: contains aspectjrt.jar, aspectj runtime library, that is needed by the application


## Application Behavior
src/cs518/a4/distributedchat/applications/Setting.java includes all configurable variables (such as group size, size threshold to merge groups, and logging folder) that enable changing the behavior of the chat application.


## Scalability
Unlike the naive approach where the central chat server receives a message from a client and broadcasts the message to all other clients, 
The developed application uses a chat server as a central server to bootstrap clients that want to join the chat session. All chat clients are aware of this central server. Every chat client is in a group (called peer group), which has a peer-group ID. The group members have their own member IDs. When a client joins a chat session, the central server informs the client about its peer group ID and group member IDs. Each client communicates with a small set of other clients (peers) and this set is determined by the central server.

When a chat client has a message that needs to be broadcast, it sends the message to all other members in its peer group and also to the central chat server. The chat server sends this message to one client in all other peer groups. That client then forwards the message to the other members existing in its group. This way, all chat clients eventually get the message and the task is distributed instead of relying on just one chat server.
